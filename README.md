My 3 queries look for PYTHON titles.

query1.json returns:
5 books that discuss PYTHON

query2.json returns:
5 books that discuss PYTHON
that have a negative rating
(there are only 3)

query3.json returns:
5 books that discuss PYTHON
that have a negative rating
(there are only 3)
And it returns only the TITLE and PRICE fields
along with the ID and SCORE

I did NOT spend any time on 
formatting the output in discovery_query.py
